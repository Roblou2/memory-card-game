<h1>Memory card game</h1>

<h2>What is this app?</h2>
<p>This is a basic memory card game with the theme of the cards being mostly '80s and '90s films. Users must select if 
they card has appeared to them before or not. If this select correctly, their score goes up by 1.</p>

<h2>How does it function?</h2>
<p>Built using React, the app displays a random image via a rendered component. Each component has a background
image of a specific film. The background image and index number of the node in an array storing all
images are passed down as a props. State is lifted up from the component to
set the state of the parent app, triggering a new random card upon user selection.</p>

**Note** I do not own any of the images or films depicted in the images, nor do I claim to own their rights. The images are
purely used for a personal project and not for commercial interest
